# Proposal — the ladder's reaction cliff (and a Goblin that never scales)

> **Superseded 2026-10-05:** the weapon-aware, test-passing version of the fix is in `docs/weapon-aware-fix-and-late-ladder.md` and `patches/weapon-aware-lapse-ramp.diff`. The patch described below is the first, longsword-only attempt.

Status: **PROPOSAL, nothing in `src/` changes in this PR.** For the Combat lane, 2026-10-04. Evidence is from `scripts/ladder-sweep.mjs`, which runs scripted players on the headless simulation, so every number below is reproducible with the commands at the end.

## 1. What was found

**Several wardens go from easy to a wall in a single ladder level.** Below the cliff a simple strategy wins 60–95 % of fights; one level later the same strategy wins 5–15 %, and the blend then barely moves until L18. Measured, 6 of the 10 live rungs: the cliff is at **L12** for the Veteran, Executioner, Dwarf and Knight, and at **L14** for the Pitborn and Shieldmaiden. Each is the level at which that warden's `reaction` first drops under 20.

**Cause, isolated.** A warden notices the player's swing `reaction` ticks after it starts (`ai.ts`, `noticed = threat && elapsed >= reaction`). The player's longsword cut has a 20-tick windup. While `reaction >= 20` the warden can never answer a cut; at `reaction <= 19` he answers nearly every one (block, parry, roll). `profileAt` blends `reaction` down by about a tick a level, so one level crosses the line. Receipt (Veteran, 150 fights per cell, `masher` / `blocker` win %):

| Fight | masher | blocker |
|---|---|---|
| L11 as shipped (reaction 20) | 58 % | 99 % |
| L12 as shipped (reaction 19) | 5 % | 43 % |
| **L12 with L11's reaction (20)** | **55 %** | **100 %** |
| **L11 with L12's reaction (19)** | **7 %** | **49 %** |
| L14 with reaction held at 20 | 49 % | 99 % |

> **Note added during migration (2026-10-05):** the `blocker` column in this table was measured with an earlier version of the blocker bot, before it punished whiffs and recoveries. `experiments/reaction-cause.mjs` with the committed bot reads 32 % (L12 as shipped) and 37 % (L11 with L12's reaction) in place of 43 % and 49 %; L11 and the "swapped back" rows are within a couple of points, and the masher column is identical. The conclusion does not change.

Changing only that one integer moves the fall to wherever the integer crosses. Other knobs are not the cause: ramping the `guard` share across L6–18 left the cliff in place (tried, not kept).

**It is not an artefact of crude bots.** `skilled` reads the move, covers the correct directional-guard side, times the parry inside the 10-tick window, rolls what cannot be parried and punishes; it falls off the same cliff (Veteran 92 % at L11, 8 % at L12; table below).

**Separate finding: the Goblin does not scale.** The Goblin's reaction is already under 20 at L6, so he has no cliff — and no slope either. A bot that only holds the right guard side wins **98–100 % at every level sampled (L1, 6, 12, 18, 32, 46, Origin included)**:

46              0%        7%        2%
```

(The Nightborn, also under 20 at L6, is the control: it declines smoothly from 72 % to 7 % for the same `blocker`.) `tests/battery.test.ts` gates only the Veteran, so nothing currently flags this.

## 1b. What else the survey turned up

The live ladder is ten rungs (`ladder.ts`: Veteran, Pitborn, Goblin, Nightborn, Executioner, Dwarf, Plague Doctor, Knight, Witch, Shieldmaiden). Everything below is about those ten; recipes marked `hold: true` are not in the game and are left out.

- **The cliff is on 6 of the 10 rungs** (above). The Nightborn and Plague Doctor, whose `reaction` is already under 20 at L6, decline smoothly instead (`blocker` Nightborn: 72 % at L6, 30 % at L18, 7 % at L46).
- **The Goblin and the Witch are easy at every level.** Goblin: a guard-only bot wins 98–100 % from L6 to Origin (§1). Witch: the same bot wins 100 % at L6, 77 % at L18, 67 % at Origin (table below); at Origin the guard-only bot wins 100 % against the Goblin and 67 % against the Witch, the two highest of the ten rungs, and no test gates either.

## 3. Proposed change (verified, not applied)

`lapse` is the chance a noticed swing gets no answer. At the first level whose reaction is under the player's cut windup, start the warden at `lapse` 0.9 and ease it down to the blend's own value over 7 levels. A warden that is already under the windup at L6 gets no ramp, and the anchors and every level outside the ramp are untouched.

### What the change trips (so it is the lane's call, not a drive-by)

Run on top of trunk `4056467` with `npm test`: 1785 pass on trunk; with the diff, 2 fail:

1. `between anchors every level is a blend: skill knobs move monotonically…` — the ramp makes `lapse` rise at the crossing, deliberately. The test needs an exemption for `lapse` (or a rule that allows exactly this ramp).
2. `a sim change without a RECORD_VERSION bump would break every live kill link` — levels 12–17 would replay differently, so `RECORD_VERSION` needs a bump (`src/record.ts`), and with it the cost of old kill links at those levels. That cost is Combat's and Dom's to weigh; nothing here assumes it.

Also: the windup is the **longsword's** (20). Other player weapons have other windups, so the same cliff sits at a different level for them; the ramp is tuned for the weapon the ladder is tuned on.

## 4. Caveats

- The bots read the simulation state directly (exact ticks, exact sides), so they are tighter than a thumb; `masher` is cruder than any person. A win rate says what a strategy *can* do. Whether L12 feels like a wall to a human is a playtest question, and these runs say nothing about feel, animation or readability (the headless sim has no renderer).
- 60 fights per cell: single cells move by about ±6 points between seed sets; the cliffs are 40–90 points.
- Level-by-level sweeps cover the Veteran, Pitborn, Executioner, Goblin, Nightborn (60 fights per cell) and the Dwarf, Knight, Shieldmaiden (40 fights per cell, L10–L15 and L18). The Plague Doctor and Witch appear only in the matrix (L6, L18, L46).

## 5. Reproduce

```
node scripts/ladder-sweep.mjs curve --n=60 --opponents=veteran,pitborn,executioner --levels=10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18
node scripts/ladder-sweep.mjs curve --n=60 --opponents=goblin,nightborn --levels=1,6,12,18,32,46
node scripts/ladder-sweep.mjs matrix --n=40 --levels=1,18
```

Apply the diff above to `src/moves.ts` and re-run the first command to see the "after" table. About 1–2 minutes each on 4 CPUs.
